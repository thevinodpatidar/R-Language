## Reserved Word In R Language

Reserved words in R programming are a set of words that have special meaning and cannot be used as an identifier (variable name, function name etc.).

The list can be viewed by typing help(reserved) or ?reserved command in R shell:
`>?reserved`
Among these words,`if`,`else`,`repeat`,`while`,`function`,`in`,`next` and `break` are used for conditions, loops and user defined functions.

They form the basic building blocks of programming in R.

`TRUE` and `FALSE` are logical constant in R.
`NULL` represents the absence of a value or an undefined value.
`Inf` is for “Infinity”, for example when 1 is divided by 0 whereas `NaN` is for “Not a Number”, for example when 0 is divided by 0.

`NA` stands for “Not Available” and is used to represent missing values.

R is a case sensitive language. Which mean that `TRUE` and `True` are not the same.
